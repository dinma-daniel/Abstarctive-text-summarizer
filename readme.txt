Abstractive Summarization Model
This is an abstractive summarization model that can generate a summary of a given text document. It uses a neural network architecture that has been trained on a large corpus of text data to generate summaries that capture the essence of the original text. The model is based on the transformer architecture, which has been shown to be very effective for natural language processing tasks.
